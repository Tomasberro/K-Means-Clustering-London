# K-Means-Clustering-London

Final project carried out for the course "Foundations of Data Science: K-Means Clustering in Python" at the University of London.
It is about a sample of true and false banknote data, extracted from the openML bank-note authentication.
At work it's about helping to put security measures in place for banks and helping them predict what will be fakes banknotes.

<div> The technologies used were Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and Jupiter Notebook. </div>
<div></div>

<div> The Clusters algorithm implemented will help us predict with an estimated accuracy of 65% the veracity of the banknotes taken into consideration in the sample, without having known in advance the true information about them. </div>
